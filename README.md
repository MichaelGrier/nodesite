# My Node.js Site
This is a site that I created using bootstrap, node.js, express, mongodb and mongoose. It has basic navigation functionality, as well as a contact form which will submit form data to a mongoDB database.

### Directions for running this project:
- ensure that port 8000 is free on your device
- run a mongoDB server on port 27017
- ensure that mongoDB contains a database called 'nodesite', with
  a collection named 'contacts'
- run command 'npm run start' in your terminal
- navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser
